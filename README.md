# CIST4B1_AdvJava
A repo to document my Java learning journey

About Me:
Hi, I am Ethan Peters. I am currently dual enrolling at Sierra College and West Valley, looking to transfer and pursuing a bachelors degree in CS. I've been programming since 2017, mainly in Game Development and small apps. 

Goals for This Course:
I look forward to expanding my knowledge on java. The previous courses stayed pretty surface level. The last time I went into more advanced Java was IB Comp Sci in highschool junior year, which was already 4 years ago. I want to refine my skills and learn more. 

In Class Warm Up file
Not sure what exactly I am supposed to put here. In class we have done a few small problems already. We made a little zoo with an Animal parent class, with 2 child classes. I chose Monkey and Tiger I believe.
